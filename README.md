# basic-mmo-phaser
Very basic multiplayer online game example made with Phaser, Node.js and Socket.io.

The tutorial corresponding to this game can be found [here](http://www.dynetisgames.com/2017/03/06/how-to-make-a-multiplayer-online-game-with-phaser-socket-io-and-node-js/).

## Installing and running the game

For the client, Phaser is included in the code (`js/phaser.js`). You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the Node.js packages required for the server. To run the server, you'll need to have Node.js installed.

Clone the repository. Inside the newly created directory, run `npm install` to install the Node.js packages listed in `package.json`. Then run `openode deploy` to deploy the server.
